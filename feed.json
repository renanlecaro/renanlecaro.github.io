My default tool for that was WordPress, because you could easily set them up, pick a theme, mess with the CSS a bit and let them write the content.</p>\n<p>I personally used a custom made static site, with or without automatic generation, for my personal project's presentation pages. But I didn't see myself explaining the details of git push, markdown and CLI use to my parents. </p>\n<p>Today i discovered Publii and thought i'd give it a try for my blog. If it's satisfactory, I might recommend it to my less tech-savy friends in the future. </p>",

After learning a bit more about Webpack at virtualQ, i wanted to see how small a modern we app could be.</p>\n<p>The main problem I was trying to solve was a personal one : I wanted to annotate a screenshot of an app to a friend before sending it to him. All i needed was to draw an arrow on a small picture. I couldn't find an app that would only do that, so I created one using the technology I knew best : front end javascript.</p>\n<p>The app is far from optimized, but it runs quite smoothly on a variety of platforms.  </p>\n<p>The app is freely accessible and open source but I haven't really worked on promoting it. Since then i've bought a new phone and don't really need as much to save space on the internal memory. I rarely make use of minimage but keep it online, just in case it might be useful one day.  </p>",
