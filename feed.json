It should reply \"OK\"</p>\n<p>To start an sms, type <strong>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\" (</strong>replace the XXX with your actual phone number) and press enter. It should go to the next line and show a \"&gt;\" character. </p>\n<p>Type the content of your message (possibly on multiple lines) then <strong>validate with ctrl+Z</strong></p>\n<p>It should lag for a second or two then display something like \"+CMGS: 6 OK\"</p>\n<p>You should then receive the sms on your phone. </p>\n<p>Exit the \"screen\" command by pressing \"ctrl+A\" followed by pressing \"d\".</p>\n<p>Summary of the commands :</p>\n<pre>AT<br>OK<br>AT+CMGF=1<br>OK<br>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\"<br>  &gt; Hey there<br>+CMGS: 6<br><br>OK</pre>\n<p>Once this works, you can investigate SMS servers like <a href=\"http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/\">smstools</a> </p>\n<p>The basics are to edit the configuration file for smstools to indicate your device location:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/smsd.conf</code><br><br><code>[GSM1]</code><br><code>#init = </code><br><code>device = /dev/<strong>ttyXRUSB6</strong></code><br><code>incoming = yes</code><br><code>#pin = </code><br><code>baudrate = 19200</code></pre>\n<p>And then create a file in /var/spool/sms/outgoing/ (the sms outbox) with the sms to send :</p>\n<pre>To: 33628350XXXX<br><br><br>Hey this is a message from smstools</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

I didn't feel like forcing an update to 4.4, which brings in two very useful features for my use case (the<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/function/\"> $function</a> operator and the ability to <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#output-to-the-same-collection-that-is-being-aggregated\">$merge</a> to the collection that you are aggregating on).</p>\n<p>So I've been $writing:{ $some: {$nested: {$queries:'It's a pain''}}} . I'm back to junior level of mastery in this new paradigm, where \"It works\" comes as a surprise. I'm sure i'll rewrite those ugly aggregations at some point, but for now they seem to do the job. </p>\n<p>One nice approach to using aggregation pipelines in meteor is to declare them in a separate js file, and then have a simple, non-meteor script that runs the aggregation and logs the results. </p>\n<p>I use nodemon to watch the files, and get a very fast feedback loop, without the need to wait for the meteor server to recompile. Great when you're learning as you go. </p>\n<p>I start the script like this (-r esm allows me to use modern imports) </p>\n<pre>nodemon -e js  -r esm tests/scripts/mongofun.js</pre>\n<p> And the script itself is very simple. It just runs the query </p>\n<p>tests/scripts/mongofun.js :</p>\n<pre>const mongoUrl='mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/meteor'<br><br>async function actual_aggregation(db) {<br>  const result = await db<br>    .collection('Orders')<br>    .aggregate([<br>      {<br>        $match: {_id:'&lt;some test id&gt;'}<br>      }, <br>      ...the_pipeline_imported_from_the_meteor_source<br>    ])<br>    .toArray();<br>  console.log(result);<br>}<br><br>const mongodb = require('mongodb');<br>const client = new mongodb.MongoClient(mongoUrl, {<br>  useUnifiedTopology: true<br>});<br><br>client.connect().then(<br>  async () =&gt; {<br>    const start = Date.now();<br>    await author_aggregation(client.db());<br>    console.log('took ' + (Date.now() - start) + ' ms');<br>  },<br>  e =&gt; console.error(e)<br>);</pre>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for today :)</p>",
