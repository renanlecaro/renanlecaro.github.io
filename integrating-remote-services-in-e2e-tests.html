The app also connects together many services, like google maps, google custom search, Stripe and Sumup.</p><p>I wanted to make sure those integrations would keep working, so i embedded the real services in my test. For example, playwright would attempt to connect to a test account at sumup when running the e2e test.</p><p>Recently, sumup changed their login flow, and added a captcha. I don't see how I can work around this. The tests are a bit flaky for a few other reasons anyway, so i think i'll just run them by hand and complete the captcha every time.</p><p>Still, i'm sure there's a better way. I tried to just copy the result of the authentication request but this only worked for a single run of the tests. During the next run Sumup would refuse them for some reason.  </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>+33 6 28 35 01 14 (Whatsapp only)</p><p><a href="mailto:renan.lecaro@gmail.com">renan.lecaro@gmail.com</a></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
