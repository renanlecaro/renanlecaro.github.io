            "content_html": "<p>Working at virtualQ, it happened a few times that I'd start a project with unclear requirements, then presented it to the rest of the team just to see everything needing to be changed or canceled. </p>\n<p>To avoid such disappointing outcome, I tried to make more design docs. A design doc is roughly said a document that will detail all the possible solutions to a problem, and serve as a support for debate, ideas and discussions. After a design doc is accepted by the team, you can go ahead with the development with less risk of requirements being inadequate. </p>\n<p>Most features would include some back end and front end elements, and some user flows. Trying to make the documents more readable, I added as many sequence diagrams as possible. Sequence diagrams are excellent at communicating a process. Their layout forces you to be succinct  as there's not much space for walls of texts and unnecessary details.</p>\n<p>I first edited the diagrams in the excellent <a href=\"https://www.websequencediagrams.com/\">websequencediagrams.com</a> and pasted a screenshot in the google documents, but that was a bit of a pain to maintain. This tool keeps a copy of the source code, so i'd just need to edit it and update the resulting picture in the google document, but no one else had access to said source code. I thought i could just save the source code in the image description field in google docs, to make it easier to update the diagram for anyone in the team.</p>\n<p>This is when I realized i could use this \"trick\" to create a <a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/mermaid/636321283856?pann=cwsdp&amp;hl=en\">google docs add-on</a>. In a classic case of \"putting off writing documentation by focusing on the tools used in documenting\", I followed the (super confusing) tutorials on the google documentation website for G Suite add-ons. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img src=\"https://renanlecaro.github.io/media/posts/8/Screenshot-from-2020-06-05-08-52-21.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the mermaid add-on in the g-suite marketplace\" width=\"989\" height=\"731\">\n<figcaption >The mermaid add-on listed in the g-suite marketplace </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The project has evolved a bit with time but stays relatively simple in terms of code. It has gathered quite a lot of users (10K) despite me not putting any efforts in marketing it. I guess we have a product-market fit here, but no business plan at all. This is really just a few lines of JavaScript to make the power of the mermaid JS library available in google docs. I don't think it makes sense to charge for it, and it costs nothing to keep it running. </p>\n<p>I've made it open source, with the code hosted on github, feel free to have a look there : <a href=\"https://github.com/renanlecaro/mermaid-gdocs\">https://github.com/renanlecaro/mermaid-gdocs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/mermaid/636321283856?pann=cwsdp&amp;hl=en\"> The mermaid add-on listed in the g-suite marketplace </a></p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Back when I was working at virtualQ, I had to do some documentation. At first I didn't quite enjoy it, feeling like this was a chore. But <strong>documenting a system can be a very interesting task</strong>. I also had to explain our systems to new hires after we raised some funds and quickly grew the team. </p>\n<p>We had a <strong>documentation website for our API</strong>, based on markdown. It was very technical, with manually copy pasted sample API responses. It wasn't very visual. It had endpoints documented publicly while they were only for internal use. It had a lot of outdated content, and felt more like a patchwork of data bits than a comprehensible thing.</p>\n<p>My fist step was to <strong>remove the documentation off irrelevant endpoints</strong>. The docs were kind of an hybrid between a public api documentation and some internal guide for new hires. I made dedicated to customers trying to use our api only.</p>\n<p>It still had a<strong> \"wall of text\" feeling though</strong>. To make it more palatable, I tried to add visuals. Integrating <a href=\"https://mermaidjs.github.io/\">mermaid</a> to the docs was quite easy, I styled it roughly with some css rules. <strong>Sequence diagrams are awesome</strong>. I used them to communicate the different workflow we had and some typical scenarios the clients would like to use our API for. </p>\n<p>We had a <strong>complex state machine</strong> that tracks the state of a caller through our system. I tried to <strong>represent it as a graph</strong>, but that was a bit too cluttered, so i split it in two graphs and removed some of the transitions that were not normally happening. </p>\n<p>Finally, I wanted to fix our <strong>outdated sample API requests and responses</strong>. Our API was evolving rapidly and having outdated samples was more confusing than helpful. I created a <strong>tiny script that curl commands and update the API answer samples</strong> with them. I had to do some dirty grepping on the answers to replace dates, ids, etc .. to avoid polluting the git log with meaningless edits every time we'd refresh the samples.</p>\n<p>We deployed the new version of the documentation. Some of our new hires still had some use for the old version (that documented more endpoints) so we added a link to it. <strong>We don't have any tracking on the docs website</strong>, so I have no idea what the readership is, but it was great as a learning experience.</p>\n<p>It made me love mermaidJS so much, that I eventually ended up building a <a href=\"https://renanlecaro.github.io/mermaid-gdocs/\">google docs addon</a> for it. </p>\n<p>I like the idea of <strong>writing tutorials as markdown, with E2E test instructions mixed in</strong>, and outputting the result (text, screenshots, response samples) as a document. It would guarantee that the tutorials stay in sync with the product and don't become outdated, with always fresh screenshots. It would make the task of writing E2E tests for some web app a dual purpose task, where you'd <strong>generate both a helpful document and some smoke tests</strong> in one go. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>It all started about 7 years ago. </p>\n<p>My mother got laid off and had to find a job. She already had a large garden and decided to <strong>make a living selling vegetables</strong>. She invested little capital as the activity was supposed to last only a few years until retirement. </p>\n<p>Therefore the production was small. Like, very small. She <strong>tried selling at the local market</strong> but you need large volumes to make the trip worth it. Clients always leave the last vegetables left in each box, they don't want to take the last few tomatoes. Turns out, those tomatoes were just the only ones she had at first.</p>\n<p>So she decided to try another sales channel : <strong>she would sell vegetables by email</strong>. Each week, she'd send a list of all the produces that were available in the garden. The clients (mostly friends and acquaintances at first) were free to order by simply replying to the email with what they wanted. At the end of the week, she'd prepare each order and clients would come to the farm to pick up their order. They would pay directly on location.</p>\n<p>Preparing orders for clients is <strong>a lot of extra work</strong>, taking orders is also quite a process, and the whole thing was a bit inefficient, but she did manage to sell vegetables. </p>\n<p>I was a student at the time at university and needed a project for a university class. With a few friends we decided to start a project that'd <strong>automate most of the process</strong> of offering products and taking orders.</p>\n<p>The business model was to create a great app for my mother, and sell it to other farmers later on as a SAAS.</p>\n<p>The first iteration was based on AngularJS, mongo, express. It was hosted on heroku. The second iteration was based on <strong>meteor</strong> with everything real time. This is the <strong>version that's still running today</strong>.</p>\n<p>The project has been running for many years. The farmer's contribution (14.90€/month) pays for the server, but with only 8 users the app is <strong>barely generating a tiny profit</strong>. I could, in theory, get a lot more users, the response to my cold calls was excellent.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But this project taught me something : being responsible for a professional tool that can crash at any moment is no fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The risk of the app crashing, the emails ending in spam, the reminder SMSs failing, etc .. is quite high, and the impact is that farmers can end up blocked in their work, and lose sales. </p>\n<p>Today, i tend to <strong>prefer creating completely free side projects</strong>, because it stresses me less to have a program crash if said program is free to use. It's also forcing me to create very lean applications that tend to be <strong>frontend only</strong>. Therefore, they can be hosted for free indefinitely. </p>\n<p>I'm still interested in the SAAS model, but I now keep in mind that <strong>being on call 24/7 limits you freedom</strong>. I live in Russia now, and would love to spend two weeks in the Trans-Siberian. But that's mean spending two weeks doing support from a train in the middle of nowhere. That's a no-go.   </p>\n<p>So, next time, I'll think a bit more before creating a product people will rely on. </p>\n<p> </p>",
