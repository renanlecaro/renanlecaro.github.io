                <p>I've always thought that WordPress was using a tank to kill a fly.</p>
<p>The surface area for attacks was too large, the admin could barely run most of the time, and the large amount of plugins was mostly a way to keep the marketing guys happy, and not a way to just make a more user friendly website.</p>
<p>As a dev, I've created some websites for family and friends. My default tool for that was WordPress, because you could easily set them up, pick a theme, mess with the CSS a bit and let them write the content.</p>
<p>I personally used a custom made static site, with or without automatic generation, for my personal project's presentation pages. But I didn't see myself explaining the details of git push, markdown and CLI use to my parents. </p>
<p>Today i discovered <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a> and thought i'd give it a try for my blog. If it's satisfactory, I might recommend it to my less tech-savy friends in the future. </p>

                <p>This was one of my first project with the main focus on page size and bundle size. After learning a bit more about Webpack at virtualQ, i wanted to see how small a modern we app could be.</p>
<p>The main problem I was trying to solve was a personal one : I wanted to annotate a screenshot of an app to a friend before sending it to him. All i needed was to draw an arrow on a small picture. I couldn't find an app that would only do that, so I created one using the technology I knew best : front end javascript.</p>
<p><a href="https://renanlecaro.github.io/minimage/">The app</a> is far from perfect, but it runs quite smoothly on a variety of platforms.  </p>
<p>The app is freely accessible and open source but I haven't really worked on promoting it. Since then i've bought a new phone and don't really need as much to save space on the internal memory. I rarely make use of minimage but keep it online, just in case it might be useful one day.  </p>
