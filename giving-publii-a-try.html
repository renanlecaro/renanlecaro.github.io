My default tool for that was WordPress, because you could easily set them up, pick a theme, mess with the CSS a bit and let them write the content.</p><p>But hosting a wordpress website is always a trade-off between reliability and costs. On one side you have free hosts giving you a terrible VM that can barely handle the administration side, on the other overpriced plans for what's really a tiny website with usually almost no traffic. </p><blockquote><p>I've always thought that WordPress was using a tank to kill a fly.</p></blockquote><p>So until now, for non technical business owners, I've set up a free host and the administration of the website was usually quite slow and unreliable. If the client wanted something more reliable, I'd get a paid hosting plan, but that would include some overhead for me. </p><p>For my personal projects I personally used custom made static websites, with or without automatic generation. But I didn't see myself explaining the details of git push, markdown and CLI use to my parents. I thought I should work on an ideal, user friendly static website editor one of those days.  </p><p>Today i discovered <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Publii</a> and thought i'd give it a try for my blog. If it's satisfactory, I might recommend it to my less tech-savvy friends in the future. Until now I've been pleasantly surprised. </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>+33 6 28 35 01 14 (Whatsapp only)</p><p><a href="mailto:renan.lecaro@gmail.com">renan.lecaro@gmail.com</a></p></div></footer></div><script async defer="defer" data-domain="lecaro.me" src="https://stats.lecaro.me/js/index.js"></script></body></html>
