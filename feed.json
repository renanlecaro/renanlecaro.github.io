I focused less on ciboulette.net than before, and had less time for side project. </p>\n<p>Working at Della has been interesting. I took over a React fronted (with Redux that i'm slowly getting rid of). I had to learn typescript, but in the end I don't fully exploit it. It helps avoid mistakes, but also forces you to write code that looks more like java than proper Javascript. I had never seen so many enums in a codebase. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm quite happy with the way things are going, and our company has been bought out by a bigger one, Legisway. I visited their offices and they are neat !</p>\n<p>One the hacking side, over the Christmas/New year vacations I started a small game project. It's a chilled out city builder, made in web tech.

            "content_html": "<p>I felt like having a small break from <a href=\"https://ciboulette.net/\">my main project</a> this month, so I'm giving myself <strong>some weeks to try out other ideas</strong> I've been putting off. Just happy coding of open source MVPs for various ideas I've had for a while. I'm giving myself a <strong>max of 7 days per app</strong> to make sure the scope stays reasonable.</p>\n<p>The first one is pretty close to done now, and it's called <a href=\"https://picnic.lecaro.me/\">picnic</a>.</p>\n<p>It's a simple web app that lets you <strong>create a plain text document and edit it with friends in real time</strong> (on PC and smartphone).</p>\n<p>It's <strong>end-to-end encrypted</strong>, so the client side does the encryption with window.crypto (despite not really adding much security) and sends that to my node server over web sockets. The server saves that document and forwards it to the other clients that can decode it thanks to the key stored in the URL. \"<strong>Rolling your own crypto</strong>\" is generally a bad idea, but I think here i'm \"using pre-made crypto\" which is alright, despite a very strong feeling on \"I have no idea what I'm doing\".</p>\n<p>Speaking of haphazardly reaching a decent solution <strong>: syncing edits is hard</strong>. When you type some words in the text, the full value of that text is sent over to the server, who forwards it to everyone as-is. So <strong>each client receives the latest version</strong>, but might have done its own edits that are not yet sent for syncing (two people typing at the same time).</p>\n<p>I end up doing a <strong>three-way merge of full text</strong>, using a homemade, quite naive approach. It works  most of the time, though it quite easily gets confused. Initially, just typing alone on the document would get super messy when the updates from the server would conflict with your local edits.</p>\n<p>My 3 way merge algorithm <strong>performs well when the edits are far from each other</strong>, but it <strong>performs terribly when two users are adding a thing at the same spot</strong> in the doc. Luckily, this only really happen when a user tries to apply his own edits. So I just made the editor ignore any edits that came from itself (using a session ID that only lasts for the duration of the web page). </p>\n<p>Furthermore, some <strong>edits would</strong> <strong>arrive in the wrong order</strong>, and my algorithm would consider a <strong>reversed addition as a deletion</strong>. I could solve that quite easily too, by just <strong>adding a version number to each document</strong>, incrementing it at each edit, and ignoring stale edits. The server keeps the authoritative value for the current version number and blocks any stale edit form propagating. </p>\n<p>Finally, the app <strong>reconnects</strong> with exponential back-off and <strong>retries</strong> to send user's edits whenever the sync fails for any reason, until it's up-to-date with the server. Overall, I'm <strong>quite pleased with the result</strong>, it's usable, loads fast and more reliable than <a href=\"https://txt.lecaro.me/\">my previous attempt</a> at solving the same project. It's also quite easy to self-host as the DB is simply the local file system.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Next we'll need to talk directly to it with AT commande, to send our first message. </p>\n<p>The difficulty is that AT commands are a super old standard, and require at some point to send the control character \"ctrl+z\". If you do that in a normal prompt, it will be recognised as a keyboard shortcut and not be sent as a character.</p>\n<p>So we have to connect to the modem using a very low level interface.</p>\n<pre>sudo screen <strong>/dev/ttyACM6 38400</strong></pre>\n<p><strong>Edit: if wvdialconf didn't work, try to connect using mincom : minicom -D /dev/ttyXRUSB6 .

It should reply \"OK\"</p>\n<p>To start an sms, type <strong>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\" (</strong>replace the XXX with your actual phone number) and press enter. It should go to the next line and show a \"&gt;\" character. </p>\n<p>Type the content of your message (possibly on multiple lines) then <strong>validate with ctrl+Z</strong></p>\n<p>It should lag for a second or two then display something like \"+CMGS: 6 OK\"</p>\n<p>You should then receive the sms on your phone. </p>\n<p>Exit the \"screen\" command by pressing \"ctrl+A\" followed by pressing \"d\".</p>\n<p>Summary of the commands :</p>\n<pre>AT<br>OK<br>AT+CMGF=1<br>OK<br>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\"<br>  &gt; Hey there<br>+CMGS: 6<br><br>OK</pre>\n<p>Once this works, you can investigate SMS servers like <a href=\"http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/\">smstools</a> </p>\n<p>The basics are to edit the configuration file for smstools to indicate your device location:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/smsd.conf</code><br><br><code>[GSM1]</code><br><code>#init = </code><br><code>device = /dev/<strong>ttyXRUSB6</strong></code><br><code>incoming = yes</code><br><code>#pin = </code><br><code>baudrate = 19200</code></pre>\n<p>And then create a file in /var/spool/sms/outgoing/ (the sms outbox) with the sms to send :</p>\n<pre>To: 33628350XXXX<br><br><br>Hey this is a message from smstools</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
