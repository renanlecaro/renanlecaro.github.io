I took over a React fronted (with Redux that i'm slowly getting rid of). I had to learn typescript, but in the end I don't fully exploit it. It helps avoid mistakes, but also forces you to write code that looks more like java than proper Javascript. I had never seen so many enums in a codebase. </p><p>Anyway, I'm quite happy with the way things are going, and our company has been bought out by a bigger one, Legisway. I visited their offices and they are neat !</p><p>One the hacking side, over the Christmas/New year vacations I started a small game project. It's a chilled out city builder, made in web tech. You can have a look at it here : <a href="https://drmp.lecaro.me/">https://drmp.lecaro.me/</a> (there's no good name for it yet). </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lecaro.me/media/posts/29/drmp-screenshot" alt="screenshot of the game" width="1918" height="916"></figure><p>That's all for today, I had to dig up this website from an old save to publish something new on my new computer. </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>+33 6 28 35 01 14 (Whatsapp only)</p><p><a href="mailto:renan.lecaro@gmail.com">renan.lecaro@gmail.com</a></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
