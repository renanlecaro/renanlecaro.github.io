After learning a bit more about Webpack at virtualQ, i wanted to see how small a modern we app could be.</p><p>The main problem I was trying to solve was a personal one : I wanted to annotate a screenshot of an app to a friend before sending it to him. All i needed was to draw an arrow on a small picture. I couldn't find an app that would only do that, so I created one using the technology I knew best : front end javascript.</p><p><a href="https://renanlecaro.github.io/minimage/">The app</a> is far from perfect, but it runs quite smoothly on a variety of platforms.  </p><p>The app is freely accessible and open source but I haven't really worked on promoting it. Since then i've bought a new phone and don't really need as much to save space on the internal memory. I rarely make use of minimage but keep it online, just in case it might be useful one day.  </p><p> </p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/minimage-2.png" alt="Screenshot of minimage" width="565" height="321" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-xs.png 300w, https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-sm.png 480w, https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-md.png 768w, https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-lg.png 1024w, https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-xl.png 1360w, https://lecaro.me/media/posts/3/responsive/minimage-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>+33 6 28 35 01 14 (Whatsapp only)</p><p><a href="mailto:renan.lecaro@gmail.com">renan.lecaro@gmail.com</a></p></div></footer></div></body></html>
