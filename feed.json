My default tool for that was WordPress, because you could easily set them up, pick a theme, mess with the CSS a bit and let them write the content.</p>\n<p>But hosting a wordpress website is always a trade-off between reliability and costs. On one side you have free hosts giving you a terrible VM that can barely handle the administration side, on the other overpriced plans for what's really a tiny website with usually almost no traffic. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I've always thought that WordPress was using a tank to kill a fly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So until now, for non technical business owners, I've set up a free host and the administration of the website was usually quite slow and unreliable. If the client wanted something more reliable, I'd get a paid hosting plan, but that would include some overhead for me. </p>\n<p>For my personal projects I personally used custom made static websites, with or without automatic generation. But I didn't see myself explaining the details of git push, markdown and CLI use to my parents. I thought I should work on an ideal, user friendly static website editor one of those days.  </p>\n<p>Today i discovered <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Publii</a> and thought i'd give it a try for my blog. If it's satisfactory, I might recommend it to my less tech-savvy friends in the future. Until now I've been pleasantly surprised. </p>",

After learning a bit more about Webpack at virtualQ, i wanted to see how small a modern we app could be.</p>\n<p>The main problem I was trying to solve was a personal one : I wanted to annotate a screenshot of an app to a friend before sending it to him. All i needed was to draw an arrow on a small picture. I couldn't find an app that would only do that, so I created one using the technology I knew best : front end javascript.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://renanlecaro.github.io/minimage/\">The app</a> is far from perfect, but it runs quite smoothly on a variety of platforms.  </p>\n<p>The app is freely accessible and open source but I haven't really worked on promoting it. Since then i've bought a new phone and don't really need as much to save space on the internal memory. I rarely make use of minimage but keep it online, just in case it might be useful one day.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image align-center\" src=\"https://renanlecaro.github.io/media/posts/3/minimage-2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of minimage\" width=\"565\" height=\"321\"></p>",
