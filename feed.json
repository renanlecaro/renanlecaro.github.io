It got laggy though, so I moved the joins logic to the meteor server, with <strong>hooks</strong> (<strong>matb33:collection-hooks) </strong>in every directions to keep denormalized fields in sync. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/605b848835c8f765d6d4626e/1025x564/5235adb0e560fb8de807e8488b2e67ec/image.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"My mess of hooks, simplified, visualized\" width=\"718\" height=\"395\"></figure>\n<p>It was a pain though, really hard to follow what was going on and to debug. </p>\n<p>There's also potential for chain reactions and never ending hooks loops. </p>\n<p>But mostly, it was <strong>buggy in edge cases</strong>. </p>\n<p>So I'm migrating away from those hooks, and creating an aggregation pipeline per collection (week, client, order) that computes all the dynamic fields for some given ids, and returns the documents where the value is different, plus some additional ids to check in the next pass. </p>\n<p>It's not yet in production, but after this rewrite, my e2e tests are passing. </p>\n<p>Meteor uses mongodb 4.2 in development server. I didn't feel like forcing an update to 4.4, which brings in two very useful features for my use case (the<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/function/\"> $function</a> operator and the ability to <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#output-to-the-same-collection-that-is-being-aggregated\">$merge</a> to the collection that you are aggregating on).</p>\n<p>So I've been $writing:{ $some: {$nested: {$queries:'It's a pain''}}} . I'm back to junior level of mastery in this new paradigm, where \"It works\" comes as a surprise. I'm sure i'll rewrite those ugly aggregations at some point, but for now they seem to do the job. </p>\n<p>One nice approach to using aggregation pipelines in meteor is to declare them in a separate js file, and then have a simple, non-meteor script that runs the aggregation and logs the results. </p>\n<p>I use nodemon to watch the files, and get a very fast feedback loop, without the need to wait for the meteor server to recompile. Great when you're learning as you go. </p>\n<p>I start the script like this (-r esm allows me to use modern imports) </p>\n<pre>nodemon -e js  -r esm tests/scripts/mongofun.js</pre>\n<p> And the script itself is very simple. It just runs the query </p>\n<p>tests/scripts/mongofun.js :</p>\n<pre>const mongoUrl='mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/meteor'<br><br>async function actual_aggregation(db) {<br>  const result = await db<br>    .collection('Orders')<br>    .aggregate([<br>      {<br>        $match: {_id:'&lt;some test id&gt;'}<br>      }, <br>      ...the_pipeline_imported_from_the_meteor_source<br>    ])<br>    .toArray();<br>  console.log(result);<br>}<br><br>const mongodb = require('mongodb');<br>const client = new mongodb.MongoClient(mongoUrl, {<br>  useUnifiedTopology: true<br>});<br><br>client.connect().then(<br>  async () =&gt; {<br>    const start = Date.now();<br>    await author_aggregation(client.db());<br>    console.log('took ' + (Date.now() - start) + ' ms');<br>  },<br>  e =&gt; console.error(e)<br>);</pre>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for today :)</p>",

Oh, i can get rid of it.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I managed to strip down the source by removing the parts I wasn't interested in. I think now the design looks clean, and I got rid of most useless css and js I could find. I'm not sure that this is the right approach, as those changes definitely won't survive a theme update (but why would I want to update it ?) and are a bit hacky. I'm pretty sure those changes are only stored on my machine, so if I try to edit the website from somewhere else it will revert back to it's default look. </p>\n<p>However, i'm not too worried about this. This personal website is a playground for experimentation after all.</p>",

I really enjoy the energy of younger friends and the large amount of free time we have.</p>\n<h2>Life is cheap </h2>\n<p>I'm renting a room on the DVFU campus, it costs barely 40€/month, but it's only possible to rent it as a student, the study itself costing around 140€/month. As a student, I can benefit from the very cheap student health insurance that costs about 50€/year. </p>\n<p>Overall, I'm spending less than 500€/month here to live quite comfortably. I'm happy to have found this opportunity. </p>\n<h2>Life is good</h2>\n<p>The Russian class starts at 10am every day. It lasts 2 hours, and is currently happening via Skype. That means I don't have to spend 3 hours in transport every day. When the confinement will be over though, we'll have to go back to physical classes, that happen in the city. Traffic is usually quite bad in the morning, and the trip without traffic from the FEFU campus to the city is about 1 hour without traffic, so it's not unusual to have to spend one hour thirty in transports to go to class. I really hope we'll have the option to keep our classes online, I find it way more convenient. </p>\n<p>We live near the sea and near nature, it's great. We've done countless barbecues, trekking trips and swimming sessions. </p>\n<p>The only scholarly thing I'm required to do to keep my student status is to be present in class. Doing the homework is recommended, but kind of optional. I don't do them anymore so that I can focus all my energy on the programming of <a href=\"https://ciboulette.net\">ciboulette.net</a>  </p>\n<h2>This too, shall pass</h2>\n<p>I won't stay eternally here, my motivation to learn Russian is lower than when I arrived, and my fascination for the country is now back to simple curiosity. </p>\n<p>I'll head back to Europe in December, to focus on the sales process of ciboulette. I'm thinking about moving to France first, to help my sister for a while with her setup in a new house. I'll do calling and development work when I have free time, and keep an eye on my niece at the same time. </p>\n<p>Then, my currently favored plan is to set myself up in Odessa, Ukraine, to enjoy the good weather, Russian speaking opportunities and affordable cost of living. French citizen get 6 months visa free there, which should be enough for me to know if I want to stay here longer or not. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>  </p>",
