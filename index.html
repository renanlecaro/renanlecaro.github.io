    <h1>Hi, I'm <strong>Renan</strong></h1>
    <p>I'm a software engineer focused on front end development.
      If you have a challenge that involves UI and javascript,
       I'd be happy to have a look. In freelance work my rate is usually 45€/hour.
     </p>
     <p>
       You can contact me by 
       <a href="mailto:renan.lecaro+enquiry@gmail.com">email</a>,
       have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/renanlecaro">Github</a> or

     <h2>I care about <strong>performance</strong></h2>
     <p>
       Today a typical web page is around 3mb. Most of the apps I make are under 500kb.
       This webpage is under 30kb. Same for the <a href="https://minimage.tk/">minimage</a>
       web app I created recently.
     </p>

     <h2>I care about <strong>clean code</strong></h2>
     <p>
       I try to improve the codebase from day to day. I've been maintaining
       <a href="https://cyberlegu.me/">CyberLégume</a> for 4 years, making it
        better each day with small refactors and improvements
     </p>

     <h2>I care about <strong>the end user</strong></h2>
     <p>
      It's really hard to make human-machine interfaces.
       It takes time to make them better, you have to see real people use
        them to discover what goes wrong.
     </p>
