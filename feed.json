Next we'll need to talk directly to it with AT commande, to send our first message. </p>\n<p>The difficulty is that AT commands are a super old standard, and require at some point to send the control character \"ctrl+z\". If you do that in a normal prompt, it will be recognised as a keyboard shortcut and not be sent as a character.</p>\n<p>So we have to connect to the modem using a very low level interface.</p>\n<pre>sudo screen <strong>/dev/ttyACM6 38400</strong></pre>\n<p><strong>Edit: if wvdialconf didn't work, try to connect using mincom : minicom -D /dev/ttyXRUSB6 .

It should reply \"OK\"</p>\n<p>To start an sms, type <strong>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\" (</strong>replace the XXX with your actual phone number) and press enter. It should go to the next line and show a \"&gt;\" character. </p>\n<p>Type the content of your message (possibly on multiple lines) then <strong>validate with ctrl+Z</strong></p>\n<p>It should lag for a second or two then display something like \"+CMGS: 6 OK\"</p>\n<p>You should then receive the sms on your phone. </p>\n<p>Exit the \"screen\" command by pressing \"ctrl+A\" followed by pressing \"d\".</p>\n<p>Summary of the commands :</p>\n<pre>AT<br>OK<br>AT+CMGF=1<br>OK<br>AT+CMGS=\"+3362XXXXXXX\"<br>  &gt; Hey there<br>+CMGS: 6<br><br>OK</pre>\n<p>Once this works, you can investigate SMS servers like <a href=\"http://smstools3.kekekasvi.com/\">smstools</a> </p>\n<p>The basics are to edit the configuration file for smstools to indicate your device location:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/smsd.conf</code><br><br><code>[GSM1]</code><br><code>#init = </code><br><code>device = /dev/<strong>ttyXRUSB6</strong></code><br><code>incoming = yes</code><br><code>#pin = </code><br><code>baudrate = 19200</code></pre>\n<p>And then create a file in /var/spool/sms/outgoing/ (the sms outbox) with the sms to send :</p>\n<pre>To: 33628350XXXX<br><br><br>Hey this is a message from smstools</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

It got laggy though, so I moved the joins logic to the meteor server, with <strong>hooks</strong> (<strong>matb33:collection-hooks) </strong>in every directions to keep denormalized fields in sync. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/605b848835c8f765d6d4626e/1025x564/5235adb0e560fb8de807e8488b2e67ec/image.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"My mess of hooks, simplified, visualized\" width=\"718\" height=\"395\"></figure>\n<p>It was a pain though, really hard to follow what was going on and to debug. </p>\n<p>There's also potential for chain reactions and never ending hooks loops. </p>\n<p>But mostly, it was <strong>buggy in edge cases</strong>. </p>\n<p>So I'm migrating away from those hooks, and creating an aggregation pipeline per collection (week, client, order) that computes all the dynamic fields for some given ids, and returns the documents where the value is different, plus some additional ids to check in the next pass. </p>\n<p>It's not yet in production, but after this rewrite, my e2e tests are passing. </p>\n<p>Meteor uses mongodb 4.2 in development server. I didn't feel like forcing an update to 4.4, which brings in two very useful features for my use case (the<a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/function/\"> $function</a> operator and the ability to <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/merge/#output-to-the-same-collection-that-is-being-aggregated\">$merge</a> to the collection that you are aggregating on).</p>\n<p>So I've been $writing:{ $some: {$nested: {$queries:'It's a pain''}}} . I'm back to junior level of mastery in this new paradigm, where \"It works\" comes as a surprise. I'm sure i'll rewrite those ugly aggregations at some point, but for now they seem to do the job. </p>\n<p>One nice approach to using aggregation pipelines in meteor is to declare them in a separate js file, and then have a simple, non-meteor script that runs the aggregation and logs the results. </p>\n<p>I use nodemon to watch the files, and get a very fast feedback loop, without the need to wait for the meteor server to recompile. Great when you're learning as you go. </p>\n<p>I start the script like this (-r esm allows me to use modern imports) </p>\n<pre>nodemon -e js  -r esm tests/scripts/mongofun.js</pre>\n<p> And the script itself is very simple. It just runs the query </p>\n<p>tests/scripts/mongofun.js :</p>\n<pre>const mongoUrl='mongodb://127.0.0.1:3001/meteor'<br><br>async function actual_aggregation(db) {<br>  const result = await db<br>    .collection('Orders')<br>    .aggregate([<br>      {<br>        $match: {_id:'&lt;some test id&gt;'}<br>      }, <br>      ...the_pipeline_imported_from_the_meteor_source<br>    ])<br>    .toArray();<br>  console.log(result);<br>}<br><br>const mongodb = require('mongodb');<br>const client = new mongodb.MongoClient(mongoUrl, {<br>  useUnifiedTopology: true<br>});<br><br>client.connect().then(<br>  async () =&gt; {<br>    const start = Date.now();<br>    await author_aggregation(client.db());<br>    console.log('took ' + (Date.now() - start) + ' ms');<br>  },<br>  e =&gt; console.error(e)<br>);</pre>\n<p>Anyway, that's all for today :)</p>",
